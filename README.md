👋 Hi, I’m Jabed-Akhtar. I have experience in field of Automotive Software (ADAS and autonomous driving). I am passionate in the field Automotive System / Software, Robotics (industrial and mobile robots), IoRT (Internet-of-Robotic-Things), Embedded System / Software, and AI (MAchine-Learning, Deep-Learning and Reinrocement-Learning).  
I have worked with Microcontroller Boards such as stm32f4-discovery-board, stmf70-nucleo-board, esp32, Raspberry-Pi etc. I have worked in the field of Autonomous driving (testing and researches) during my Internships, Working student jobs, and thesiss. I have good knowledge of Robotics, IoT and intermediate knowledge of AI/CI (Computational Intelligence), which I learned at my University (Hochschule) and also during working as hobby. Main focused field is Autonomous driving and robotics (industrial and mobile robots).

👩‍💻💻 Feel free to contact me, if you are interested in such fields and want to do projects together. I will be more than happy to do such projects together as a team.
