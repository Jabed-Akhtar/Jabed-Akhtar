👋 Hi, I’m Jabed-Akhtar. I am currently studying Mechatronics and Robotics (M.Sc.) at Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences. I am also doing my Master-Thesis at Continental Autonomous Mobility Germany GmbH, Eschborn.  

I like working in fields such as Microcontrollers, Autonomous driving, Robotics (industrial and mobile robots), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Artificial intelligence (AI). I have worked with Microcontroller Boards such as stm32f4-discovery-board, stmf70-nucleo-board, esp32, Raspberry-Pi etc. I have worked in the field of Autonomous driving (testing and researches) during my Internships, Working student jobs, and thesiss. I have good knowledge of Robotics, IoT and intermediate knowledge of AI/CI (Computational Intelligence), which I learned at my University (Hochschule) and also during working as hobby. Main focused field is Autonomous driving and robotics (industrial and mobile robots).

👩‍💻💻 Feel free to contact me, if you are interested in such fields and want to do projects together. I will be more than happy to do such projects together as a team.
